	<p>HasGeek&#8217;s next event is a big one. We&#8217;re bringing Droidcon to India!</p>

	<p>Droidcon is India&#8217;s first international Android conference and a part of the worldwide Droidcon series of events. Android has been the single most successful mobile platform in the last few years and is a hotbed of innovation on hardware, software and business models. Droidcon brings together hands-on developers with various ecosystem partners. It&#8217;s now the world&#8217;s largest series of Android events, reaching out to thousands of developers.</p>

	<p>Droidcon India will be on 18 &amp; 19 November 2011 in Bangalore. We&#8217;re hosted at the MLR Convention Centre in Whitefield, a new facility that is equipped with top notch infrastructure including an 800+ seater auditorium, 500-seater hall, breakout rooms for smaller discussions, and a large exhibition area.</p>

	<p>Droidcon India follows HasGeek&#8217;s typical model of participant-driven selection of sessions. Session proposals are <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/">currently being accepted</a> and tickets are already <a href="http://droidcon.doattend.com">on sale</a>. Early Geek pricing expires this weekend, so hurry!</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ll have <a href="http://droidcon.in">a new website</a> up this weekend. If you&#8217;ve liked what we&#8217;ve built for previous events, this one&#8217;s taking it a notch higher!</p>
